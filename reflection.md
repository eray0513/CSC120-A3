- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I consulted Ruby in order to figure out which attributes we needed and how to set up our arrays. I also consulted her for help on my Math.random method. I attended Jordan's office hours on Friday. I have been writing in java since junior year of high school, so I do not have any initial impressions however I really enjoyed implementing java for this assignment. Some conclusions I can draw are that different languages have different purposes and different reasons to use them. Thus, learning many languages is very necessary in the programming world. However, all languages share common threads that can help to figure out new languages. What worked was asking for help and using print statements to check what you are generating in order to debug. What didn't work was not putting comments in as I went (I need to get better about that!). The advice I would give to someone in the future is to ask for help and that talking out loud can help tremendously.
